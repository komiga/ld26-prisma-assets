These here are the assets for Prisma. Same license as code.

## But I just want to play it!

Then you are probably looking for the [Ludum Dare entry page]

## Where is the code?

In the super-repo. You can find the repo [here on GitHub]
(https://github.com/komiga/ld26-prisma) if you just want to
poke around.
