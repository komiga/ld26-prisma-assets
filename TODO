## world/1

-	Channel right is one tile longer than channel left! Argh!

## world/2

-	Reverse switch positions? Players seem to always go right because
	the left switch changes to the color of the right one.
	Hmm. Want them to make that choice correctly, though. But it
	contradicts the right path message in w6. Reverse both switch and
	end trigger positions? I think so.

## world/3

-	This is an intro world, reduce the timer duration.

## world/7

-	Move path to w1 down a bit? "Alright, there's nothing here, guess
	I'd better move along."

-	Merge with w0? Make a full playthrough change the state of w0
	(secret path, change message, make spawn color invisible).
(QAR)

-	The message here doesn't seem to be making the player suspicious
	enough. How could this be changed? Still want it to be very subtle.
