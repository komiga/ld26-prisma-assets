## world/1

-	Channel right is one tile longer than channel left! Argh!

## world/3

-	This is an intro world, reduce the timer duration.
(QAR)

## world/7

-	Move path to w1 down a bit? "Alright, there's nothing here, guess
	I'd better move along."

-	Merge with w0? Make a full playthrough change the state of w0
	(secret path, change message, make spawn color invisible).
(QAR)

-	The message here doesn't seem to be making the player suspicious
	enough. How could this be changed? Still want it to be very subtle.
